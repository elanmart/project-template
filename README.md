# {project_name}

# Note
This repository implements a structure that I enforce on all my projects.

It contains some directories and files that can be used for example to seamlessly run experiments on AWS,
or to keep track of multiple experiments (logging and visualizing).

If you're not interested in any of this functionality, please see the `clean` branch of this repo. It contains
only the core functionality.

```bash
git checkout clean
```

# Run

# Test
```bash
cd {project_name}
pytest -v
```
